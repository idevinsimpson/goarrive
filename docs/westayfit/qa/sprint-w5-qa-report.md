## Scope and constraints held

- Read-only on every branch reviewed (`git show` / detached worktree only; no modification, no push to another branch).
- Regression probes added ONLY as new `apps/westayfit/tests-e2e/sprint-w5-*.spec.ts` or
  `functions-westayfit/tests/callable/sprint-w5-*.test.ts` files. No existing test or product UI edited.
- No deployments, no `gcloud secrets` access, no IAM/WIF/network-policy change, no rules/index deploy.
- No test skipped, disabled or weakened. No secrets, join codes or enrolment codes printed.
- No approval or merge recommendation issued for any PR — the Program Director reviews, the owner decides.

## Status

- Part 1 — independent review of #393: in progress.
- Part 2 — member-work QA (identity switching, pending/unknown outcomes, short-phone 390x640, #390 visibility/rejoin and payload identity): queued.

Findings are recorded in this PR's body and, for #393, as one comment on PR #393.
